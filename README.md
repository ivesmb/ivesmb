### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#I'm a cartographic engineering student at the Federal Rural University of Amazonia (UFRA). I've worked at the institution as a monitor for the subjects of programming techniques and algorithms. My work is focused on developing geospatial and engineering solutions, using python, javascript and R as my main programming languages. I also have an affinity with web page development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
