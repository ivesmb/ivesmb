**Hi there** 👋

📍 My name is Ives Brandão and I'm from Belém, Pará, Brazil

🌎 I'm a cartographic engineering student at the Federal Rural University of Amazonia (UFRA). 

🗺️ I've worked at the institution as a monitor for the subjects of programming techniques and algorithms. 

🛰️ My work is focused on developing geospatial and engineering solutions, using Python, JavaScript and #R as the main programming languages, along with remote sensing, aerophotogrammetry and cartography techniques. 

🖥️ I also have an affinity with web page development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
